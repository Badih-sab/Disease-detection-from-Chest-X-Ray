# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification 🩻🤖

This project builds a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, showing how AI can support medical diagnosis.

## 📦 Dataset
- [Chest X-Ray Pneumonia (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)  
- 5,863 images split into train, test, and validation  
- Two classes: `NORMAL`, `PNEUMONIA`

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Data exploration & visualization  
2. Preprocessing (resize, normalize, augment)  
3. Build CNN model (with optional transfer learning)  
4. Train with class weighting for imbalance handling  
5. Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~80%  
- Model can detect pneumonia vs normal chest X-rays.
